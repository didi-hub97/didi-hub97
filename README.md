##### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 
Data is all around us. its in the links you click, the videos you stream online, in the pictures, write ups and videos you upload.
So much data is generated that businesses need people to turn those data into insights to make data driven and informe decisions as you can no longer base
business decisions on intuition when you have data.</br>

**That is what I do, I make data speak.**
